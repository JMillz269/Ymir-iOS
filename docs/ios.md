# Ymir on iOS

This is the iOS port of Ymir. It runs the same emulator core as the desktop builds, rendered with the Metal graphics backend and a native SwiftUI interface. It targets arm64 iPhones and iPads on iOS 16 or later.

## Installing

The [iOS workflow](../.github/workflows/ios.yaml) builds an **unsigned** `ymir-ios-arm64-*.ipa` and uploads it as a build artifact. Download it from the workflow run and install it with a sideloading tool (AltStore, SideStore, Sideloadly, TrollStore, etc.), which signs it with your own certificate.

## Adding BIOS images and games

Ymir stores everything in its Documents folder, which shows up in the Files app under **On My iPhone > Ymir**:

| Folder             | Contents                          |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `roms/ipl`         | Saturn BIOS (IPL ROM) images      |
| `roms/cdb`         | CD block ROM images (optional)    |
| `roms/cart`        | Cartridge ROM images              |
| `games`            | Discs imported from the Games tab |
| `backup`, `state`, `savestates`, `screenshots` | Saves and state    |
| `exports`          | Targets of save/export dialogs    |

## Native interface

The iOS app has a native SwiftUI interface (sources in `apps/ymir-sdl3/src/ios`) instead of the desktop menu bar:

- **Games** lists the disc images found in the Ymir folder (`.cue`, `.chd`, `.iso`, `.ccd`, `.mds`). The emulator stays idle until you tap a game. Swipe or long-press a game to delete it. The sort button (top left) orders games by recently played, title A to Z, title Z to A, or manually; in manual mode tap **Reorder** and drag games into place. The **+** button imports games or a BIOS with the system document picker and opens the Ymir folder in the Files app. Long-press a game to set its artwork (from Photos, Files or a Google Images search where you touch and hold the image you want) or to rename it; the name only changes in the app. Artwork is stored in `covers`, and a `.png` or `.jpg` named like the disc image next to it is used too.
- **Settings** replaces the menu bar and the desktop settings window with native pages: Display, Audio, Controls (peripherals, deadzones), Emulation (speed, rewind), System & Region, Cartridge, CD Drive, Performance & Accuracy and Interface, plus BIOS import. The only thing not available is editing individual button and hotkey bindings; controllers use the default bindings.
- **Settings > Display > Stretch to Fill Screen** fills the whole display with the game picture, ignoring the aspect ratio and integer scaling. In portrait the picture fills the width, is scaled by the same factor vertically, and sits at the top of the screen; the *Extra Portrait Height* slider stretches it further down.
- **Settings > Display > MetalFX** upscales the picture with the GPU: *Spatial* works frame by frame, *Temporal* also reuses previous frames (the Saturn has no motion vectors, so it supplies none and fast movement can ghost slightly).
- **Settings > Display > Picture Filters** adds *Sharp Pixels* (crisp pixel edges), *Sharpening*, *Scanlines* and an *Aperture Grille* (CRT look). They are applied after MetalFX in a custom Metal shader.
- On iOS 26 and later the tab bar and the buttons use Liquid Glass; older systems get translucent materials. The settings home is a stack of glass cards on a soft colourful backdrop; the settings pages and the Save States manager are built from the same glass cards: `GlassForm` (a page), `GlassSection` (a card with a title and footnote; the rows get dividers) and `GlassPicker` (a menu row), all in `Theme.swift` and used like `Form`, `Section` and `Picker`. The cards and texts are given the exact width of the screen: letting them negotiate it made them as wide as their longest line of text.

Import a BIOS first (Games tab banner or Settings > System). Files can also be copied by hand into `roms/ipl` and `games` with the Files app, or shared to Ymir with **Open in...**. Pick every file of a multi-file image (e.g. the `.cue` and all `.bin` files) at once so they end up side by side; `.chd` and `.iso` images are single files and avoid this.

## Controls

An on-screen Saturn control pad is drawn over the game: D-pad, A/B/C, X/Y/Z, L/R, Start and a Menu button. It is mapped to the default port 1 Control Pad binds, so it works out of the box. Fingers can slide between buttons and multi-touch works.

- The **Menu** button on screen, or **Select/Back** on a controller, opens the in-game menu: resume, pause, fast forward, reset, disc tray, save states, screenshots, settings, a way back to the game library and **Close Game**. The game is paused while the menu is open.
- **Customize Layout…** (in the in-game menu, or Settings > Controls) lets you drag every control anywhere, drag and resize the game screen itself, tap one to resize it, snap controls to a grid, change the size of all controls and their opacity, or reset. Portrait and landscape have separate layouts, saved in `state/touch_layout.cfg`.
- **Settings > Controls > On-Screen Controls** turns the overlay off.
- The overlay hides itself while a hardware controller is connected. MFi, Xbox, PlayStation and other controllers supported by iOS work through SDL's gamepad support and use the same default binds as on desktop.

## Internal resolution

**Settings > Display > Internal Resolution** draws VDP1 graphics (polygons, sprites, lines: the 3D models of most games)
at 2x, 3x or 4x the Saturn's resolution. Every VDP1 command is drawn once at the normal size, which stays what the
emulated CPU sees, and once more into a larger framebuffer with all coordinates multiplied; VDP2 then composes each
screen line once per sub-pixel using the large sprite data, so layer priorities, transparency and shadows work as usual.
The image reaches the screen at the larger size and is scaled to the display with whole-number steps.

Limits: VDP2 backgrounds are tile and bitmap based and stay at their original sharpness; textures are sampled per large
pixel, so they stay blocky when magnified. Frames in modes that can't be enlarged (high resolution, interlaced, 8-bit or
rotated VDP1 framebuffers) are rendered at native size. Transparent Meshes works together with it: the mesh layer is kept at the larger size too. The cost grows
with the square of the scale, so 4x needs a lot more CPU than 2x.

**Skip Native Drawing (Experimental)** stops drawing each command at the normal size as well. At the end of every frame
the normal-size framebuffer (what the emulated CPU reads back) is copied from the first sub-pixel of the enlarged one.
This saves roughly the cost of a native VDP1 pass. Games that read the framebuffer while a frame is still being
drawn see the previous contents, and a thin line the enlarged drawing doesn't put on that sub-pixel can be missing
from the readback (never from the picture).

## Metal renderer (experimental)

**Settings > Display > Metal Renderer** draws the Saturn's second video chip (VDP2: the background layers, the sprite
layer built from VDP1's framebuffer and the final mixing of all of them) with the GPU, using the same compute shaders as
the Direct3D 12 renderer on Windows. VDP1 (polygons, sprites and lines) is still drawn by the software renderer on the
processor. Moving VDP2 to the GPU frees a good part of the processor time a frame takes and lowers heat.

**Draw Polygons and Sprites on GPU** (needs the Metal renderer) moves VDP1 to the GPU as well. The processor only turns
the VDP1 commands into lines of pixels; the GPU draws them (all the texture, shading, shadow, half-transparency and
MSB modes) into the framebuffer memory, which stays on the GPU. The processor gets a copy of the framebuffer only when
the game reads it back (some games do, e.g. for effects), which makes the processor wait for the GPU, and for save
states.

**Internal Resolution** works with it too (2x to 4x): every VDP1 command is drawn a second time on the GPU with scaled-up
coordinates into larger framebuffers (the normal-size one stays what the emulated CPU reads), and VDP2 composes each
screen line once per sub-pixel, drawing the sprite layer again from the large framebuffer for each of them. This costs
GPU time that grows with the square of the scale (4x draws and composes sixteen times). Frames in modes that can't be
enlarged are composed at the normal size. With Skip Native Drawing the GPU draws VDP1 commands into the larger
framebuffers only, and fills the normal-size framebuffer from them (the first sub-pixel of every pixel) when it's needed:
when the framebuffers swap, before a command that can only be drawn at the normal size and when the CPU reads the
framebuffer.

With Direct Display (on by default) the finished image is copied into a texture of the display on the GPU, and the
display waits for it on the GPU before scaling it (MetalFX, filters), so it never goes through the processor and arrives
in the same frame; screenshots read it back. With it off, the image is read back from the GPU and shown through the
normal display path, one frame late. Internal Resolution, Transparent Meshes and
Deinterlacing need the GPU VDP1 option. With
Transparent Meshes the mesh layer is drawn at the internal resolution too, and Skip Native Drawing works with it. If it
can't be created the
setting is turned off again and the software renderer is used.

When the CPU reads the VDP1 framebuffer, the copy on the GPU is downloaded only if something drew into it since the last
download: the CPU's own writes reach both copies alike, so a game that reads, writes and reads again waits for the GPU
once.

### Frame timing

Frame Pacing (Display settings, with Video Sync on) picks how frames are timed. Exact Speed runs the Saturn at its own
rate (59.83 Hz NTSC) on a timer, so a frame is shown twice about every 6 seconds on a 60 Hz display. Match Display
runs the timer at the display's rate instead (60 Hz, every second refresh at 120 Hz), one game frame per display frame;
waiting for frames to reach the screen was tried first and let a ProMotion display drop its refresh rate. The
emulation then runs 0.3% fast and the sound is played back that much faster through the audio stream's frequency ratio,
nudged to keep the sound buffer half full. Either way the minimum time each frame stays on the screen is rounded to
whole refreshes of the display, minus half a refresh, so a ProMotion display never holds a frame for an extra refresh.
Every 600 frames the log also notes when frames actually reached the screen (`display: ...`): how many stayed up longer
than meant or were never shown.

Frame Delay (Auto) starts emulating each frame later than the display asks for the previous one, so that the game reads
the controls closer to when the frame is shown. The emulator thread measures how long each finished frame waits for the
display (its spare time) and moves the start so that about 6 ms are left for the GPU to finish the picture and for
heavier frames: it backs off by 4 ms at once when a frame nearly misses and creeps up by at most 3 ms a second, up to
12 ms.

### Save states

Autosave (Emulation settings, on by default) saves a state of the game into a slot of its own, "Autosave", whenever the
game is left: the app is covered or sent to the background (the control center, a call, the app switcher, the home
screen; not more often than every 5 seconds), the game is closed, or another game or state is started or loaded (not when
the Autosave itself is loaded). The emulator thread writes it while the app is still active, as the picture of the game is
read back from the GPU for its thumbnail, which isn't allowed in the background. Save states get a small thumbnail
(`<slot>.jpg` next to them) of the frame on the display when they are saved. Pause When Interrupted pauses the game while the
app is not active, and the game menu opens when headphones are unplugged.

Save States (Settings) lists the save states of every game, with their date and size: Load starts the game and continues
from the state, Export shares a copy and Delete removes it (or all of a game's states). Long-pressing a game in the
library offers Load State with the game's slots, newest first. Save states are kept per game in
`savestates/<disc hash>/<slot>.savestate`; the hash can't be worked out without reading the disc, so the emulator notes the
disc image a folder belongs to in `game.txt` there (the path relative to the Ymir folder) whenever the game is started
or a state is saved. States made before that are listed as an unknown game, by the title on the disc, until the game has
been started once.

### Game Mode

Game Mode: the app declares `GCSupportsGameMode` (and is in the games category), so iOS can switch Game Mode on while
a game is in full screen: the system then gives the game priority on the CPU and GPU and lowers the latency of Bluetooth
controllers and AirPods. Whether it is on is up to the system (Control Center shows it); the stats panel shows it too.
When the app is run inside another app (LiveContainer), the system goes by that app's own settings instead.

### Diagnostics

The detailed measurements (frame and CPU times, time per thread, GPU time, the scaled up image counts, when frames reach
the screen, FBRAM downloads) are only taken and written to `metal-vdp-log.txt` while Performance Log (Performance
settings) is on. While it is off nothing is written to the log at all, and no log file is made.

Diagnostics: the Metal renderer writes `metal-vdp-log.txt` to the Documents folder (started anew at every launch).
Creating a folder named `metal-vdp-compare` there makes the software renderer draw VDP1 as well, and the log then lists
the frames where the GPU's framebuffer differs from the software renderer's (with the pixels, the commands of the frame
and a few more details). That is much slower; delete the folder for normal play. `tools/render-tests/vdp1_gpu_emu_test.cpp`
runs the VDP1 compute shaders ported to C++ against the software renderer on a desktop machine.

Creating a folder named `metal-vdp-profile` in the Documents folder makes the log also list, every 300 frames, how
many milliseconds per frame the GPU spent on each kind of pass (VDP1 drawing and merging, at the normal and the scaled up
size, erasing and writes, the VDP2 layers and composition, and the passes of the internal resolution). That runs the
passes in separate encoders, so it is a little slower; delete the folder for normal play.

The log is kept in two files, `metal-vdp-log.txt` and `metal-vdp-log-previous.txt` (the 4000 lines before it), so it stays small however long the game is played.

`tools/render-tests/hr_render_test.cpp` renders a synthetic scene headlessly through the software renderer
(`build.sh` builds it against a core build) to check the output and time frames.

## JIT (SH-2 recompiler)

The core has an SH-2 recompiler that translates Saturn CPU code into ARM64 machine code. It is **off by default** and
**experimental**. Turn it on in Settings > Performance & Accuracy > CPU Execution; the option is greyed out until the
process can obtain executable memory.

How it works: straight-line code is translated into native blocks of up to 64 instructions. Register instructions
(ALU, shifts, multiplies, MAC.W/MAC.L, DIV0S/DIV1, CMP, control register moves), loads and stores to RAM and ROM (including the
PC-relative, GBR-relative and post-increment/pre-decrement forms), and all branches, including their delay slots, are
emitted as ARM64 code with the interpreter's exact cycle counts, load-use stalls and bus timings. A branch back into the
same block becomes a jump, so tight loops stay in native code. Everything else (accesses to hardware registers and other
non-RAM addresses, TAS, the read-modify-write byte instructions, LDC to SR, RTE, TRAPA, SLEEP) calls the
interpreter's own handler, so those behave exactly as they do there. Blocks are checked against the code in memory every
time they run, and a write into a block's own code ends the block. A block that ends in a branch to a known address jumps
directly into the next block (after checking that its code is unchanged) instead of going back through the emulator's main
loop. The five most used SH-2 registers of each block are kept in host registers while it runs. Compiling the 68K sound CPU is not done.

Getting JIT access on iOS (the app has to be signed with `get-task-allow`, which sideloading tools do for development
signing; TrollStore installs get JIT differently):

- **iOS 26+ on A15/M2 or newer (TXM)**: needs a JIT enabler that supports TXM, such as StikDebug with its universal
  script. It attaches a debugger and answers Ymir's `brk #0xf00d` request for an executable region.
- **Other devices**: any debugger-based enabler (StikDebug, SideStore's JIT, AltServer, Xcode) works; Ymir then maps
  regular read/write/execute memory.
- **Settings > Performance & Accuracy > Enable JIT…** asks StikDebug, StikJIT or StosDebug to enable JIT for Ymir
  through their `enable-jit` URL.

The recompiler is skipped while SH-2 cache emulation or debug tracing is on. If something breaks, switch back to
**Interpreter** (no restart needed).

Tests: `tools/jit-tests` checks the ARM64 assembler against Keystone and runs random programs on the interpreter and
the recompiler side by side (the generated code executes in the Unicorn CPU emulator). Those pass; the recompiler has
not been run on an actual device yet.


**Skip Idle Waiting** (Settings > Performance & Accuracy, off by default): a processor that spends a whole time slice in
recompiled code without writing to memory, calling the interpreter (this includes any access to hardware registers) or
changing any register is waiting for something. While both processors are waiting, the emulator runs them in 512 cycle
steps instead of 32, so they notice changes made by the other processor or by hardware up to 512 cycles later and the
emulator loop's own work is done far less often. The count of slices spent waiting is shown with the recompiler's
statistics. Loops that poll hardware registers are never treated as waiting, with one exception: a loop that keeps reading the
SH-2's own free-running timer or watchdog (which count the CPU's cycles and so don't change while a block runs) and gets
back exactly the same state each time round has each repeated iteration claim 24 extra cycles, so the identical iterations
are not all run. This is the common way games wait for a time to pass; the statistics show the number of such skips.

## Known limitations

- Save and export dialogs don't exist on iOS; they write to `Documents/exports`.
- Update checks are disabled. Rebuild from the workflow to update.
- The Metal renderer and the GPU VDP1 option are experimental. Skip Native Drawing can confuse games that read the picture
  while it is still being drawn.
- At higher internal resolutions a thin line has been seen where polygons meet on a bridge in one game; it is not fixed yet.
- Save states made before the Save States manager existed show as an unknown game until the game has been started once.
