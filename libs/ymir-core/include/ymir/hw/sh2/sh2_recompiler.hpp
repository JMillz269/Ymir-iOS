/**

@brief Dynamic recompiler (JIT) for the SH-2 CPU, targeting AArch64.

Straight-line sequences of instructions are translated into native blocks. Simple register-only instructions are
translated into inline AArch64 code; every other instruction is executed by calling into the interpreter's own
instruction handler, so its behavior (including bus accesses, wait states and timing) is exactly the same as in the
interpreter. Blocks keep the interpreter's cycle accounting, stop at the same points the interpreter would (cycle budget
and interrupts), and are validated against the code memory every time they are entered.
