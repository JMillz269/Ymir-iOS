@brief Executable memory for dynamic recompilers.

Handles the differences between platforms:
- iOS with TXM (iOS 26+ on A15/M2 and newer): memory can't be flipped between writable and executable. A read+execute
  pool is reserved and prepared by the JIT enabler (StikDebug/StosDebug "universal" script) through `brk #0xf00d`, and a
  writable alias of the same pages is created with `vm_remap`. Code is written through the alias and run from the pool.
- iOS without TXM: a debugger-enabled process (CS_DEBUGGED) may map read+write+execute memory.
- macOS (Apple silicon): `MAP_JIT` with per-thread write protection toggling.
- Other AArch64 systems: read+write+execute anonymous memory.

The recompilers only generate AArch64 code, so on any other architecture JIT is reported as unsupported.
