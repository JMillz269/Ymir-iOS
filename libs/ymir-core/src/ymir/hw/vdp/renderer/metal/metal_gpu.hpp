/**

@brief The part of the Metal VDP renderer that talks to the GPU.

`MetalVDPRenderer` works out what has to be drawn and what the shaders have to be told, and hands it to this interface.
The implementation lives in metal_gpu.mm so that the rest of the renderer is plain C++.

Everything submitted here executes on the GPU in the order of the calls: a VRAM upload takes effect for the passes
submitted after it and not for those before it. Data passed by pointer is copied during the call.
